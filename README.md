# anki_rails
Collection of [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) flashcards pertaining to Ruby, Rails and major gems

Currently the deck contains:
```ruby
  Rails = %w(validations)
  Gems = %w(rspec-rails)
```

I am in the process of adding more of [Active Record](ACtiveadmin.info) and Rails elements such as basic helpers, [Active Support](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_core_extensions.html) etc, and this repo will be updated along the way. Stay tuned!

This is a raw export of the actual package, which may be found on [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/decks/):

The [main file](https://github.com/coisnepe/anki_rails/blob/master/rails_and_gems_anki_deck.txt) is formatted with syntax highlighting specifically for Anki. I'll try to convert it to a more versatile csv for use in third-party apps.

You're welcome and encouraged to collaborate on this project; simply fork and make pull requests from your `master` branch!
